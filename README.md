# Dot Files

### These are my configuration files for Vim, Zsh, VScode and other various programs related to coding.

To quickly install these files, you can run one of the setup scripts in your terminal.

Example:
```console
you@dontincludethispart:~$ bash setup.sh
```

* Setup.sh will install everything.
* Setup-vim.sh will install Vim-plug, symlink my vimrc, and install all the listed Vim plugins in my vimrc file.
* Setup-git.sh will only symlink my gitconfig and gitignore files.
